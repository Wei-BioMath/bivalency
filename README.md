# Mathematical modeling of H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent chromatin 

Run run_ODE.m to obtain steady-state solutions and phase plane for the deterministic model

Run run_SSA.m to perform stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and obtain the stochastic trajectory 

Note: please keep all .m files in the same folder to call functions main_SSA, fl and fnl
